EatIT

Ruby Version 2.0.0,
MongoDB

The parse should work to insert your recipes into a MongoDB if the recipe files meet the scrape reqirements. 

Front-end consists of HTML5, SASS, Angular.js, Underscore.js, and jQuery. 

You'll need to deploy and create your own database, that is not covered by the App.
